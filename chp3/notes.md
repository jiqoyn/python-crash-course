CHAPTER 3 LISTS

A list is a collection of items in a particular order. 

Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any8 element in a list by telling python the position, or 'index' of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list folowed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets. 
    - Index positions start at 0 not 1.
    - Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. if you ask for the item at index -1, you'll get the last item in the list. 
    Useful if you need to know the last item in a list without knowing exactly how long the list is. (can also use -2, -3, and so on)
